FS - Synchronusly, other, differences 

sync, console log will be going line to line and there is a difference between the execution times, Imagine a user is going to run this program and then another user will not be able to use the app until it is fone

async, console log will be going line to line here again but the difference now is that in the async, it offloads the reading process, and would be easier for the above example

npm gives you everything, ppls code, your solution to a code etc etc
